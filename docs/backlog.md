# Backlog

Tickets are [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jakubiszon26/apiforge/issues),
one per ticket, titled `<ID>: <goal>` and labelled as the
[development process](process/README.md#labels) says. Their state — open,
closed, `decision-needed`, `awaiting-acceptance` — lives there and nowhere
else. This file names the current sprint, its exit criteria and the issues
in it, and keeps the record of finished sprints.

At most three pull requests await owner acceptance at a time.

## Sprint: KTLO (2026-10-26 to 2026-11-08)

Keep the lights on: stabilise what Stage II shipped and run the new process
end to end once. No new features. Exit criteria:

- [ ] Migration of the owner's real workspace works, or is switched off by an
      owner decision (KTLO-03, #5).
- [ ] No ignored test without a ticket; the identity checkpoint decision is
      made (KTLO-04, #6).
- [x] The block library in the folder mode is accepted by the owner through
      the full process: mock-up, acceptance tests, QA report (KTLO-05a #7,
      KTLO-05b #8; accepted 2026-10-26). Follow-ups: KTLO-05c #22,
      KTLO-05d #23.
- [ ] The process documents were followed once end to end, and amended where
      the pilot required it.
- [ ] The regression smoke list has run on Linux and on Windows (KTLO-07, #10).
- [ ] The two interface findings the owner raised on the mock-ups — one header
      above the board (KTLO-12, #16) and an editor without a box (KTLO-13,
      #17) — are accepted through the same mock-up → test → report path.
- [ ] The KTLO retrospective is written and its actions are issues (KTLO-10, #13).

If the criteria are not met by 2026-11-08, the sprint is extended; feature
work does not start.

## Later

Feature work resumes after KTLO exits. Candidates, unestimated:

- [#14](https://github.com/jakubiszon26/apiforge/issues/14) KTLO-11 Scenario
  navigation in Diagram mode (from the KTLO-05a decision).
- Hiding the block library panel in Split by choice (owner's wish, 2026-10-26).
- The interaction-test `settle()` also waits for a debounced analysis whose
  pause has not passed (review finding on #19; not a cause of any failure).
- `resolving_one_documents_conflict_leaves_another_documents_unsaved_work_and_history`
  failed once on windows-2022 after #19 (run 40304041875) and passed on the
  same commit: a foreign write was not seen as a conflict. Timing-sensitive;
  needs a ticket if it repeats.
- Removal of the legacy JSON mode once the KTLO-06 parity list is closed.
- Roadmap M7 editor features ([roadmap](roadmap.md)).
- Windows release gates: interactive native QA and directory durability
  ([Stage II plan](stage-ii-code-workspace.md#delivery-and-acceptance)).
